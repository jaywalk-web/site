			<h2>The Feed Was Never Neutral</h2>
<p>Every scroll feels harmless — a few seconds of curiosity, a quick check-in, a break between tasks. But behind that gesture lies an entire infrastructure designed to hold your gaze.  Meta’s platforms were never built for your wellbeing. They were engineered for extraction — extracting time, data, and attention. Every reaction, notification, and “recommended post” is an algorithmic decision made to keep you engaged just a little longer. The more you scroll, the more you give away.<//p>

<p>Over time, this system does more than occupy your screen; it occupies your mind. It shapes what you see, how you feel, and even what you believe. Scrolling is no longer a passive act — it’s participation in an economy that thrives on distraction, and every time you step back, you interrupt that cycle. You take back a fragment of your agency in a world built to take it from you.</p>

<h2>The Awareness Gap: How Exploitative Design Works</h2>
<p>The most powerful tools of digital control don’t look like control at all. Features like infinite scroll, auto-play, and engagement-driven feeds appear convenient, but they are the outcome of behavioral design deliberate mechanisms built to capture and commodify human attention.</p>

<p>Each feature is based on psychological principles that exploit the way our brains respond to uncertainty, validation, and novelty. Every refresh promises something new, keeping us hooked in a loop of anticipation and reward. The result is a subtle but profound loss of autonomy. The fatigue, restlessness, and constant sense of “missing out” we feel are not personal weaknesses they are symptoms of systems designed to make us feel that way. This is the awareness gap.</p>

<p>Recognizing that your distraction is not accidental but engineered is the first step toward reclaiming focus. Awareness turns passive use into conscious choice — and that’s where resistance begins.</p>

<h2>Reclaiming Agency: Attention as a Moral Stand</h2>

<p>Stepping back from Meta isn’t about abandoning technology. It’s about redefining your relationship with it. When you choose to log out, mute notifications, or spend a day offline, you’re not rejecting digital life — you’re asserting control over it. In an economy that profits from your engagement, choosing not to engage is a moral act. It’s a refusal to feed systems that monetize distraction and manipulate emotion. It’s a declaration that your attention your most intimate resource is not for sale.</p>

<p>This is the foundation of Jaywalk’s mission. We believe that awareness is a form of empowerment, and that resisting exploitative design begins with understanding it. Jaywalk is more than a campaign; it’s a call to see clearly, act intentionally, and reclaim the agency that algorithms have quietly eroded.</p>

<h2>From Awareness to Action: Enter Upscrolled</p>

<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/jaywalkapp/upscrolld.PNG" alt="Why Stepping Back from Meta Helps Us Reclaim Our Attention" class="article-image">


<p>Awareness is only the first step. Action is the next. If <a href="https://www.jaywalkapp.org" target="_blank">Jaywalk</a> represents the movement toward digital mindfulness, <a href="https://upscrolled.com/en/" target="_blank">Upscrolled </p>is where that movement comes to life. It’s a social platform built around ethical design — a space where connection is conscious, not compulsive.</p>

<p>Unlike Meta’s infinite feeds, Upscrolled encourages slower, more meaningful engagement. It values depth over virality, dialogue over dopamine. The platform is designed to nurture awareness, creativity, and authentic exchange without the constant pull of algorithmic manipulation.</p>

<p>Choosing Upscrolled isn’t just about switching apps; it’s about supporting a different vision of the internet — one that prioritizes human wellbeing over profit. It’s about building an ecosystem where attention is respected, not exploited.
</p>

<p> A Call to Awareness</p>

<p>Stepping back from Meta doesn’t mean disconnecting from the world; it means reconnecting — with your time, your focus, and your freedom to choose how you engage. When you reclaim your attention, you’re doing more than protecting your mental space. You’re taking part in a quiet revolution against systems built to consume it.  Because reclaiming your attention isn’t just self-care. It’s civic care. It’s a stand for autonomy in an age of algorithmic control. And every revolution, no matter how small, begins with awareness.</p>
